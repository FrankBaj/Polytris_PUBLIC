# Description
- This project involved the creation of a Game called "Polytris", which is based on the open source game called "Hextris". This project made use of the Python programming language along with the "Pyglet" Game library.
- The basic idea of this project was to take some piece of open source software and to redesign it in a way that improves it, all the while creating documentation for it and following the Software Development Lifecycle.
- This project also involved the creation of Documentation such as the Module Guide, Module Internal Specification, Development Plan, Software Requirements Specification, Test Plan, and Test Report.

# What I learned:
- Game Design.
- Increased understanding of the Python programming language.
- Understanding of the Pyglet library and its functions.
