# Polytris
- A group project involving the creation of a Game called "Polytris".
- The purpose of these separate repositories on GITHUB is, firstly, to make accessing the files for myself easier; secondly, to keep the files safe just in case something happens to the original repository; and thirdly, to document the project, its members, and what I learned from it.

# Project Contributers:
- Purv Patel
- Maninder Sran
- Francis Bajamunde

# Description
- This project involved the creation of a Game called "Polytris", which is based upon the open source game called "Hextris". This project made use of the Python programming language along with the "Pyglet" Game library.
- The basic idea of this project was to take some piece of open source software and to redesign it in a way that improves it, all the while creating documentation for it and following the Software Development Lifecycle.
- This project also involved the creation of Documentation such as the Module Guide, Module Internal Specification, Development Plan, Software Requirements Specification, Test Plan, and Test Report.

# What I learned:
- Game Design.
- Increased understanding of the Python programming language.
- Understanding of the Pyglet library and its functions.
- Practice of working in a team in order to accomplish project goals.
- Proper Documentation of a Software Project.
- Use of the Gantt software in order to properly schedule project goals.
- Proper Project Presentation.

# NOTE:
Please contact me if you wish to have access to the Polytris Source Files and Documentation in my Private Repository. Otherwise, the GITLAB link should contain all of the files.
